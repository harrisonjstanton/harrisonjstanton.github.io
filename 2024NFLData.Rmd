Right now, some of the names and stats aren't lining up on the first tab when guys play for two teams in one season. I think by getting teams from the pbp doc this should fix this.

Important thing to note: for first tab, I want to separate when a guy plays on different teams. for the second tab, I don't: they should be lumped. For the third tab, it should be back to if a guy played on two teams, he has two entries. 

This is super close to being right. I just want to make sure that if they played on two teams, they have two observations. Darrynton Evans, for example.

LAST THING TO CHECK BEFORE I PUBLISH IT USING 2024 DATA: 
GUYS WHO PLAYED ON BOTH TEAMS SHOW UP FOR TRAP GRAPH AND SHOW UP FOR WEIGHTED OPPS. SCATTERPLOT IS GREAT RN.

9/7
Everything looked good except for some teams started to have 200% showing on the trap bar graph and I have no idea why. Also, filter gsis_id out of the stats df in the bottom of the page. The Michael Carter/two team issues were fixed though

```{r}
column_names <- c("Total_touches", "Total_HVT", "TRAP", "total_fantasy_points", "total_fantasy_points_exp", "games", "ppg", "xppg", "HVT_perc", "HVT_per_game", "Touches_per_game", "weighted_opps", "wo_per_g")
```


#All of Trap Percentage Doc
```{r}
pbp_2024 <- load_pbp(2024) %>%
    # filter(!(is.na(receiving_yards) & !(is.na(receiver_player_id)))) %>%
    filter(is.na(two_point_conv_result)) %>%
    filter(season_type == "REG")
#don't wanna get team from here, wanna get it from pbp_2023, then group_by(gsis_id, team, week)
roster_2024 <- fast_scraper_roster(2024) %>% 
  select(depth_chart_position, full_name, gsis_id, team, pfr_id) %>% 
  filter(depth_chart_position == "RB")
```

```{r}
#this will work once there are two weeks down...
week_list <- pbp_2024 %>%
  select(week) %>%
  distinct(week) %>%
  pull(week)
```


```{r}
pbp_2024 <- pbp_2024 %>%
  mutate(
    gsis_id = case_when(
      is.na(receiver_player_id) & is.na(rusher_player_id) ~ 'NA',
      is.na(receiver_player_id) ~ rusher_player_id,
      TRUE ~ receiver_player_id
    )
  )
```


```{r}
ff_2024 <- load_ff_opportunity(seasons = 2024, stat_type = "weekly", model_version = "latest")
ff_2024 <- ff_2024 %>% 
  filter(week < 19)

week <- toString(max(ff_2024$week))
season <- toString(max(ff_2024$season))



ff_2024 <- ff_2024 %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  mutate(occurrences = n())

ff_2024 <- ff_2024 %>%
  drop_na(player_id) %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  mutate(occurrences = n())


ff_2024 <- ff_2024 %>% rename(gsis_id = player_id)

ff_2024 <- ff_2024 %>% filter(gsis_id %in% roster_2024$gsis_id)

col_to_sum <- c("total_fantasy_points", "total_fantasy_points_exp")
```

```{r}
rb_df <- ff_2024 %>%
  group_by(gsis_id, week) %>%
  summarize_at((col_to_sum), sum)
```

This isn't quite right, but I don't have time to figure it out right now. Just trying to get a team variable to the guys from the pbp dataframe, not from roster_2023, that way if a player plays on two teams his stats will appear for both.

```{r}
tt_all <- pbp_2024 %>%
   group_by(gsis_id, week) %>%
   filter(is.na(two_point_conv_result)) %>%
   filter((!(is.na(receiving_yards) & !(is.na(receiver_player_id)))) | !is.na(rusher_player_id)) %>%
   summarize(
    Total_touches = n(),
    team = first(posteam)
    )

hvt_all <- pbp_2024 %>%
  group_by(gsis_id, week) %>%
  filter((!(is.na(rusher_player_id)) & yardline_100 <= 10) | (!(is.na(receiver_player_id))) & incomplete_pass == 0 & interception == 0) %>%
  summarize(
    High_value_touches = n(),
    team = first(posteam)
  )
```

```{r}
tt_all <- tt_all %>%
  filter(!gsis_id == "NA")

hvt_all <- hvt_all %>%
  filter(!gsis_id == "NA")
```




Looks good for this part... Michael Carter is an example of a guy who actually logged games on two teams 
```{r}
# tt_all <- pbp_2023 %>%
#   group_by(gsis_id, week) %>%
#   filter(is.na(two_point_conv_result)) %>%
#   filter(!(is.na(receiving_yards) & !(is.na(receiver_player_id)))) %>%
#   summarize(
#     Total_touches = n(),
#     team = first(posteam)
#     )
# 
# hvt_all <- pbp_2023 %>%
#   group_by(gsis_id, week) %>%
#   filter((!(is.na(rusher_player_id)) & yardline_100 <= 10) | (!(is.na(receiver_player_id))) & incomplete_pass == 0 & interception == 0) %>%
#   summarize(
#     High_value_touches = n(),
#     team = first(posteam)
#   )
```

```{r}
teams <- roster_2024 %>%
  distinct(team, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(team) %>%
  pull(team)

new_entries <- c("RB1", "RB2", "RB3")
```



#High value touches section
```{r}
hvt_all <- hvt_all %>%
  group_by(gsis_id, week) %>%
  mutate(Total_HVT = sum(High_value_touches)) %>%
  ungroup()



hvt_all <- hvt_all %>%
  distinct(gsis_id, week, .keep_all = TRUE)


hvt_all <- hvt_all %>%
  select(gsis_id, week, Total_HVT, team)

#hvt_all <- hvt_all %>% rename(gsis_id = receiver_player_id)
```

#High value + total touch data frame
```{r}
hvt_tt_df <- left_join(roster_2024 %>% select(depth_chart_position, gsis_id, full_name, pfr_id), tt_all, by = "gsis_id")
```

```{r}
hvt_tt_df <- left_join(hvt_tt_df, hvt_all %>% select(gsis_id, week, Total_HVT), by = c("gsis_id", "week"))
```

Might need to drop the NA in name and stuff like that, not in total_hvt especially if they played... that's important
Maybe add in a column for this if Total_touches is showing up as NA
Probably drop NA for week is more ideal... that would be if they didn't even appear on special teams 
```{r}
hvt_tt_df$Total_HVT <- ifelse(is.na(hvt_tt_df$Total_HVT), 0, hvt_tt_df$Total_HVT)
hvt_tt_df$Total_touches <- ifelse(is.na(hvt_tt_df$Total_touches), 0, hvt_tt_df$Total_touches)
```

This should work for all running backs. Probably just wanna go through tomorrow and filter this all out from fantasy pros, compile it into one document, probably filter out all the columns too. I just want name, team, proj_pts. Gonna need to workaround the not having a player id on this b too. Then gonna want to join this at the end with the running back/te/qb/wr ones too. 
```{r}
projections <- read_csv("RBWeek1.csv", col_types = cols(.default = "c"))
```

```{r}
colnames(projections) <- c("Player", "Team", "ATT", "Rush_YDS", "Rush_TDs", "REC", "Rec_YDS", "Rec_TDs", "FL", "Proj_fpt", "Week")
```

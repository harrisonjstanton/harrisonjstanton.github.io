Players drafted in rookie drafts 2015-2024
```{r}
ADP_data <- read_csv("Rookies drafted 2015-2025 - Sheet1.csv") %>%
  rename(full_name = Name)

```


rowbind this to the end of rookie database, then save as well. Going to have to rebind extra zeros as well. 
Add Roman Wilson to this list once he plays
probably gonna need to add monangai here too, see if this ish works or not. might have to add a bucket for him too.

#Adding buckets to df without temp so i don't get error when rejoining
UPDATED 7/22
I still need to redo these buckets. Somewhere (draftbuckets.rmd? i redid these in a better way, need to shrink bucket sizes, especially for QB and TE)

Going to have to redo these as well once I look at the numbers/position breakdowns for rookies actually drafted in dynasty drafts
```{r}
Rookie_database <- Rookie_database %>%
    mutate(
    bucket = 
      case_when(
        position == "WR" & pick < 16 ~ 1,
        position == "WR" & pick < 33 & pick >= 16 ~ 2,
        position == "WR" & pick < 66 & pick >= 33 ~ 3,
        position == "WR" & pick < 100 & pick >= 66 ~ 4,
        position == "WR" & pick < 170 & pick >= 100 ~ 5,
        position == "WR" & TRUE ~ 6,
        position == "RB" & pick < 33 ~ 1,
        position == "RB" & pick < 66 & pick >= 33 ~ 2,
        position == "RB" & pick < 100 & pick >= 66 ~ 3,
        position == "RB" & pick < 180 & pick >= 100 ~ 4,
        position == "RB" & TRUE ~ 5,
        position == "TE" & pick < 33 ~ 1,
        position == "TE" & pick < 95 & pick >= 33 ~ 2,
        position == "TE" & pick < 120 & pick >= 95 ~ 3,
        position == "TE" & pick < 155 & pick >= 120 ~ 4, 
        position == "TE" & TRUE ~ 5,
        position == "QB" & pick < 10 ~ 1,
        position == "QB" & pick < 21 & pick >= 10 ~ 2,
        position == "QB" & pick < 33 & pick >= 21 ~ 3,
        position == "QB" & pick < 100 & pick >= 33 ~ 4,
